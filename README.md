## Gameplay
Gameplay consists of a fusion of tactics/turn based rpg combat
Manage formations of troops on battlefields
Zoomed out macro view of your pods of warriors
Can zoom in and micro manage individual conflicts in a large battle
Can tab between your pods quickly and easily
Have hero units that can take down grunt soliders quickly, cast battlefield-wide spells, or go toe to toe with elite enemy units
Can sacrifice turns in individual conflicts to move troops over to other pods
If you spend too much time focusing on one pod, indicators that your other pods are struggling will appear
Notifications of other units on the battlefield
Potentially program pods so they have instructions of what to do when you are not micro managing
Focus is more emphasized on turn based combat than strategically moving your troops.
